# Haami
Haami is a Persian word that means "supporter". The website's vision is to provide opportunities for Afghanistan women to do online further education at home to become a freelancer and start working from home. <br>
Haami is a website that tries to connect 3 groups of people. The first group is Afghanistan women who are not allowed to get educated and have jobs by the Taliban. The second group is supporters, those people around the world who want to help Afghanistan Women in this hard situation. And the third group is the institutes that provide online education. <br> 
So online education centers can offer their courses and training on the website. At the same time, Afghanistan women can apply for the courses. Then supporters can select applicants among all the applicants and pay for the cost of the courses directly to the institutes. They can also track supported students' progress.

- __The Home Page Banner__
  - The home page banner shows an Afghan woman wearing the Burka hijab, which she was forced to wear by the Taliban, buying a few slices of bread. I used this image to show the current situation of Afghan women. Bread has deep meaning and respect in Afghan culture. One of the common words for bread is "Rozi" which means you earn money so that you can eat something. The woman in the picture represents Afghan women who worked, had jobs before, and could bring bread (Rozi) to their home. But it is different now.  
  - There are logo and text on the home page image that make some questions in users' minds.

## Testing 

- Lighthouse in Developer Tools <br>
![Lighthouse Scores](https://github.com/strasse34/first-project/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/lighthouse.png) 
- HTML Validator
  - 12 errors and warning were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator]https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fstrasse34.github.io%2Ffirst-project%2Findex.html). I fixed all the errors but could not fix all the warnings due to shortage of the time. I just fixed one of the warnings and it effected the Login part in Navbar in smaller screen below 720px. 
- CSS Validator
  - 2 errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstrasse34.github.io%2Ffirst-project%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en). Unfortunatelly I couldnot fix the error due time shortage.
  - I would like to mention that, I test both HTML and CSS before deployment and got nothing. But after deployment I got many errors. 
### Unfixed Bugs
There is an error while validating in W3C. I tried with Microsoft Edge too and got the same error. I explored the internet and found out that there is a problem with Github. Github is working on it at this moment.  
## Deployment
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click Pages
  - Under Github Pages, click on button "Visit Site".
